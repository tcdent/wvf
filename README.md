## About WSL

Worldview State Language (WSL) is a specialized format for preserving how concepts are understood within large language model contexts. It provides a structured notation for storing beliefs, stances, and understanding—designed to be semantically dense enough to remain fully in context rather than requiring selective retrieval.

For full details, see [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).
